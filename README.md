# Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation

### About this Project:

This is a **Unsupervised Machine learning Capstone project.**

This project is done for **Almabetter pro Program.**

This project aims to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set for a UK-based online retail.


### Problem Description :

In this project, your task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

### The need of customer segmentation:

The differences in customers' behaviour, demographics, geographies, etc. help in classifying them in groups. Learning about different groups in the customer can help with following:

Target Marketing

Client understanding

Optimal product placement

Searching for new customers

Revenue growth


### Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model to determine customer value:

The RFM model is quite useful model in retail customer segmentation where only the data of customer transaction is available. RFM stands for the three dimensions:

Recency – How recently did the customer purchase?

Frequency – How often do they purchase?

Monetary Value – How much do they spend?

A combination of these three attributes can be defined to assign a quantitative value to customers. e.g. A customer who recently bought high value products and transacts regularly is a high value customer.

### Approach taken
* Data inspection
* EDA / Feature analysis
* Data preparation
* Create RFM model
* Implementing various clustering

Conclusions

## Conclusions:

### Descriptive Analysis

**The data exploration of Online customer segmentation dataset shows :**

* Missing and duplicate values were found.
* Most of the purchases are from the United Kingdom.
* Most of the customers have purchased items on Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday.
* Most of the customers have purchased items in November, October, December, and the least number of purchases in April, January, February.
* Most of the customers purchase in the afternoon time. The 12th hour of the day is a peak for purchasing items.

### Model Analysis

**After applying various algorithms, optimal number of cluster is equal to 2.**



### Further analysis

● New variables have been added, such as tenure, which is the number of days since each customer's first transaction. This will reveal how long each customer has been a member of the system.

● Customers are being segmented more deeply based on their physical location, as well as demographic and psychographic factors.

● Incorporating data from the company's Google Analytics account. Google Analytics is an excellent tool for tracking a variety of essential business data, including Customer Lifetime Value, Traffic Source/Medium, Pageviews perVisit, and Bounce Rate of a company's website, among others.
